Leopold FC980C Replacement Controller
=====================================

This PCB replaces the controller of the Leopold FC980C keyboard to allow running
alternate firmware, especially open source firmware such as [QMK][QMK]. This
project relies heavily on the prior reverse engineering work done by hasu (aka
tmk) and collaborators.

This is the first PCB I have designed and as such I suspect this will have many
areas that can be improved. I am very much looking forward to hearing feedback
about this design, if you think something can be improved please open an issue
and let me know. I will list my reasons for various design decision below as
well as an errata section to list shortcomings on the current design I am aware
of.

**Specs:**
- STM32F401 MCU as found on the Blackpill boards
- Open Hardware licensed under CERN OHL-S v2
- designed to be assembled by [JLCPCB][JLC]

Getting started
---------------

If you have received this controller fully assembled, your next step will be
firmware setup (TBD - still waiting on first production run).

In case you still have to solder on the connector, see the assembly section
below.

Assembly
--------

This PCB is intended to be manufactured and assembled by JLCPCB, **except** for
the connectors and a button on the bottom side.

The button (BOOT0) is through-hole and easily soldered by hand. Make sure to
place it on the bottom side, i.e. opposite side of the MCU where the DIP
switches are on the original controller board.

The connector for the USB board (USB) is though-hole and can be hand soldered.

The SWD header is optional and can be left unsoldered.

The connector labeled KEYBOARD is only available for surface mounting and
unfortunately not available at JLC for assembly (at least at the time of
design). Hand soldering is a bit more challenging for this connector. Make sure
to use a healthy dose of flux and fine solder wire.

Production
----------

While the PCB itself can be manufactured by a number of PCB houses, component
selection and SMD assembly is made with [JLCPCB][JLC] in mind. The
`jlcpcb/production_files` folder for each revision should include the necessary
BOM and CPL files in addition to the Gerbers. The board parameters are specified
in the PCB design file (the main parameters being a board thickness of 1.6mm and
2 copper layers). This board is compatible with JLC's "Economic PCBA" option.

The EEPROM (U4) and accompanying decoupling capacitor (C6) are optional. The
board should work without those populated.

Design review
-------------

The specific component selection is tailored to what was available at JLCPC at
the time of design. While things like the capacitors and resistors can be easily
substituted, Larger ICs such as the USB protection, fuse, 3.3V regulator, MCU,
and I2C level shifter have not been evaluated for alternative parts.

The USB and KEYBOARD connectors interface with the existing connectors used in
the FC980C and cannot be substituted.

I don't intend to sell this controller PCB by myself and as such everyone who is
interested in the design is meant to order this directly from JLC for
themselves. As such, I've tried to minimize cost for low quantity production
runs. JLC has the concept of extended and basic parts where the former incurs a
one-time setup fee per production as those components quire additional labor for
setting up the pick and place machines with the respective components. I've
tried to keep the number of extended components as low as possible.

### MCU

The main requirements for the microcontroller were 5V tolerance and good
compatibility with QMK. Is also tried to take pricing and availability for the
foreseeable future into account. My choice fell on the STM32F401 that is used in
the cheap "Blackpill" development boards and has good QMK support. It is also
already used in [another project][RFR1Replacement] that replaces the controller
and PCB of the Realforce R1 TKL keyboards.

### I2C level shifter

The I2C bus on the main FC980C "switch" board is pulled-up to 5V. The original
controller is directly connected to this bus even though it is 3.3V (albeit 5V
tolerant). This seems to work fine despite the fact that the I2C peripherals on
the board specify a minimum of 3.5V for logical high. Because of that I have
decided to include a I2C level shifter. The specific component was chosen based
on what was already available in good quantities at JLC.

### Protection circuitry

The 5V fuse and USB protection components have been carried forward from the
original RP2040-based design and have been taken from
[this][RP2040DesignGuide] RP2040 design guide.

### USB traces

USB trace width has been calculated using the KiCad built-in calculator
following a [guide on the Digikey blog][DigikeyUSBTraceGuide]. The wide traces
are caused by board design being two layers and having a thickness of 1.6mm.
This is most likely overkill as the bandwidth requirements are very low for a
keyboard. Reviewing a number of other boards, none were using USB-specific trace
widths.

Errata
------

None so far, but the board has not been build and tested yet. It is only a
matter of time.

Revisions
---------

### Revision 1

First design that has a chance to actually work in the FC980C. Switch to a
STM32F401 microcontroller. This MCU allows saving a couple of components
compared to the RP2040, such as USB termination resistors and external flash.

One notable addition compared to the previous revision is an optional 64Kb
EEPROM.

**Sample tested and working:** not yet

### Revision 0

![rev0 PCB](img/rev0-board-render.png)

The first version of this PCB uses a RP2040 controller. Unfortunately, the
FC980C electronics rely on the MCU to be 5V tolerant. I have noticed this fact
while triple checking the design *just* before submitting it for manufacturing.
The RP2040 is *not* 5V tolerant and would require level shifters on many I/O
lines. Because of that I decided to scrap the design and start new, but since
the board design was pretty much complete, I'm including it in this repository
for posterity.

**Sample tested and working:** no

Acknowledgements
----------------

This replacement controller relies heavily on the [prior reverse engineering
work][GeekhackFC980CInvestigation] of the keyboard community, including
uncovering [schematics][FC660CSchematics] for the similar Leopold FC660C that
were submitted to the FCC that helped me figure out the I/O voltage
requirements. In particular, I want to thank hasu (aka tmk) who created a FC980C
replacement controller based on the ATmega32u4 MCU, publishing schematics (but
no design files) and a [open source firmware implementation][TMKFC980C] for tmk
that has been [ported][QMKFC980C] to QMK.

The PCB has been designed using KiCad and production files have been exported
using [Bouni's JLCPCB tools plugin][BouniJLCPlugin].
